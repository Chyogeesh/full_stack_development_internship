It is a internship assignment
To develop a social media analytics dashboard using React for the front end and Java (Spring Boot) for the back end, we'll outline the basic structure and provide example code snippets for setting up both parts of the application. This will include setting up the back end with Spring Boot to handle API requests and data management, and setting up the front end with React to display the dashboard with analytics.

Backend Setup using Java (Spring Boot)
Create a Spring Boot Project:

Use Spring Initializr or your IDE to create a new Spring Boot project with dependencies for Spring Web, Spring Data JPA (if using a database), and any other dependencies you may need (like Lombok for reducing boilerplate code).
Define Entity Classes:

Define entities to represent your social media data, such as User, Post, Analytics, etc., annotated with JPA annotations for persistence.
