To develop a social media analytics dashboard using React for the front end and Java (Spring Boot) for the back end, we'll outline the basic structure and provide example code snippets for setting up both parts of the application. This will include setting up the back end with Spring Boot to handle API requests and data management, and setting up the front end with React to display the dashboard with analytics.

Backend Setup using Java (Spring Boot)
Create a Spring Boot Project:

Use Spring Initializr or your IDE to create a new Spring Boot project with dependencies for Spring Web, Spring Data JPA (if using a database), and any other dependencies you may need (like Lombok for reducing boilerplate code).
Define Entity Classes:

Define entities to represent your social media data, such as User, Post, Analytics, etc., annotated with JPA annotations for persistence.
Frontend Setup using React
Create a React App:

Set up a new React application using Create React App or your preferred method.
Install Necessary Packages:

Install packages like axios for making HTTP requests and any UI libraries you want to use (e.g., reactstrap for Bootstrap components).
Integrate with Backend APIs:

Adjust API endpoint URLs (axios.get('/api/users')) to match your Spring Boot backend endpoints.
Run and Test:

Start your React app (npm start) and navigate to see the dashboard in action.
Notes:
Security: Implement security measures like JWT authentication and authorization in both the backend and frontend as needed.
Deployment: Deploy backend and frontend separately (e.g., backend on Heroku, frontend on Netlify) or together depending on your setup.
Database: If using a database, configure database settings in application.properties (Spring Boot) and adjust entity mappings accordingly.
This setup provides a basic framework for building a social media analytics dashboard using React for the frontend and Spring Boot for the backend, leveraging RESTful APIs for communication between them. Adjust and expand as per your specific requirements and additional analytics needs.
